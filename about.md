#### What is a Dosage Predictor?

**Dosage Predictor** can be used to predict the ideal dosage interval between the prednisone dosage - **daily, weekly, vehicle** in Muscular Dystrophy.

#### Algorithm used 
Random Forest

#### About the genes (parameters) in the predictor

The seven genes, namely **Dmd, Fbxo32, Klf15, Mef2a, Anxa6, Cxcl12, cc17** are the potential gene regulators with respect to prednisone, in Muscular Dystrophy, that are identified upon performing various downstream analysis.

#### On what basis is the threshold selected?

Based on the gene function, certain genes are expected to be up-regulated, while a few to be down-regulated:

**Dmd** - Dystrophin maintains the structural integrity of the cell, expected to be up-regulated

**Fbxo32** - inhibits the cell proliferation, expected to be down-regulated

**Klf15** - muscle healing gene, expected to be up-regulated

**Mef2a** - activates most of the stress-induced genes, expected to be down-regulated

**Anxa6** - genetic modifiers in Muscular Dystrophy, expected to be up-regulated

**Cxcl12** - attracts leukocytes and lymphocytes, macrophages, CD4 Tcells & CD8 Tcells, expected to be up-regulated

**Ccl7** - recruits Tregs, expected to be down-regulated

#### Ideal Prediction?

From the various analysis, Weekly dosage showed a significant impact on muscle healing, stress control, and many other benefits, thus **WEEKLY** is the ideal prediction for this experiment.
